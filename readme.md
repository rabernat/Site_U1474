# __Final Project__


## __SUMMARY__

Over the past year, I have been collecting data on variations in sediment provenance in southern Africa during the past 150 kyr from core U1474 off the coast of South Africa (from IODP Exp 361). Changes in sediment provenance can be linked to variations in runoff between the different rivers that supply terrigenous sediment to the east coast of Southern Africa. So far, I have downcore K-Ar ages of clays from samples taken every 3kyr which I hope to compare with physical property data and XRF core scanning data from the same core.

Figure 1. Map of study area and sites from Expedition 361. Major surface ocean currents are shown in yellow. Main river catchments delivering terrigenous sediment are shown with blue and green outlines. My focus is site U1474 off the coast of South Africa.

## __GOALS__

My goal is to determine whether the changes observed in the K-Ar record are coeval with any variations in physical properties which are also linked to terrigenous sediment deposition. By determining wether K-Ar ages of mud are coeval with variations in physical properties I hope to show whether the K-Ar age changes can represent terrigenous sediment processes or something different about the sediment transport and deposition.
